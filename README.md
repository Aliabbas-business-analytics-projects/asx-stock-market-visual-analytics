# 📊 ASX Stock Market Visual Analytics  
## Strategic Insights & Performance Analysis — GMD Stock (ASX)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a **stakeholder-level visual analytics study** of GMD stock performance on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).  

Using Excel-based financial analysis and data storytelling, the project transforms historical trading data into clear insights covering:

- Trading volume dynamics  
- Portfolio growth performance  
- Market capitalisation trends  
- Valuation metrics (P/E ratio)  
- Yield and return movement  

The analysis is designed to communicate insights clearly to investors and decision-makers rather than focusing on complex modelling.

## 🧠 Executive Summary

GMD demonstrated strong bullish behaviour throughout FY2024 with consistent price appreciation supported by high trading volume. Portfolio simulations show significant growth potential despite temporary corrections, while valuation and yield metrics suggest increasing investor confidence.

**Key outcomes:**
